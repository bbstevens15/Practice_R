#the number of pills is going to be driven by the number of pills perscribed in the county
#so we are going to use a multivaraite regression
#multivariate meaning we have more than one outcome
#multiple means more than one predictor

#lm is the function in base R for regression
# before the tilde is the outcome, after the tilde are the predictors
#data = is the name of the dataset you want it to use
#you can wrap in summary to get it to give you the outcome
#I like to name mine then use summary
#we see population size is driving everything
